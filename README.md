# simpleEKG-EMG_OLIMEX
Cross-platform, Python (3.6.x) user interface for the OLIMEX SHIELD-EKG-EMG (https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/Shields/SHIELD-EKG-EMG/) for an Arduino Leonardo. This is a simple data recording user interface I put together because Electric Guru was not available for my platform.
